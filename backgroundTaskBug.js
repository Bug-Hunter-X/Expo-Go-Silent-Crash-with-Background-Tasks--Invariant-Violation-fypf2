This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test an app that uses a background task. The app crashes with no error message in the Expo Go app, but the error message `Invariant Violation: Native module cannot be null` appears in the console. The problem is that the background task is not properly registered with Expo's background task APIs.  This often happens when the `TaskManager` isn't correctly set up or if the background task function isn't defined correctly.
